# Farkle

First pass at this project I built farkle.py.  After a long plane ride where I wrote a new main.py, I changed farkle.py to farkle.py.old.

I based a lot of this program around examples from Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python from NoStarch Press.  Much of the setup is directly ripped from that text.
